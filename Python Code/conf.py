# Set global variables

lidar_refreshrate = 20 #Hz
#TFmini-Plus readout on Raspberry Pi Pico does not work responsively
#with frame rate set to anything higher than 30Hz at 115200 baud rate.

#Generally:
#1Hz-5Hz usable for non-critical range sensing (slow response application)
#6Hz-9Hz good frame rate for semi-critical range sensing
#10Hz-30Hz best for super critical range sensing

# 20 Hz seems to have worked well when measuring speed.
