**Short project overview Â Introduction**

Until cars reach full autonomy, people speeding will remain a problem. There are several ways to mitigate this and a collective term for these methods is "traffic calming." In cities they make roads narrower, install speedbumps, build roundabouts and set up adaptive speed signs. Out in the country side, methods are often less sophisticated but they don't have to be.

In this study I propose a method using IoT to create a low power device that can give drivers visual feedback on their driving while also logging the events for further analysis.

Using LIDAR to measure the speed of oncoming vehicles, a servo arm to visually indicate the drivers speed and transmitting the data over LoRaWAN to a server.

**How much time it might take to do (approximation)**

I have spent countless hours going down countless rabbit holes while researching this project. I approximate that I have spent around 40-50 hrs/week during 5 weeks. They say time enjoyed is never wasted and am inclined to agree.

I put in the work so that you don't have to. If you follow this guide the estimated time to complete it is as follows:

- Research and parts acquisition -- 2 to 5 hours

- 3D-printing components -- 2 to 3 hours (not including print time)

- Speed trap assembly -- 2 to 5 hours

- Speed trap configuration and calibration -- 2 to 3 hours

- Server installation and configuration -- 2 to 3 hours

- Installation and commissioning -- 1 to 2 hours

Your mileage may vary depending on your previous knowledge and equipment at home, but between 11 and 21 hours does seem reasonable. Much more reasonable than the 200 -- 250 hours I've spent, don't you think?

**Why you chose the project**

My parents live in the countryside on a farm and the recommended speed on the road going through the farm is 20 km/h. Not everyone adheres to these recommendations and animals or people might get hurt because of it.

I chose this project as I saw an opportunity to solve a real-world problem, to help drivers reduce their speed! All while learning as much as I can about IoT and the world surrounding it. I'd get to research hardware and software and how they interface with each other and the physical world. Fun!

**What purpose does it serve**

This project serves as a way of implementing a digitized form of traffic calming, helping drivers reduce their speed. It also processes and stores data for further analysis.

**What insights you think it will give**

With the data gathered one can start drawing conclusions. When are people speeding? In the morning while late for work? At night when they think no ones watching? What direction has the highest average speed? How many cars pass in a day? What percentage of those cars are speeding?

These are just some of the answers we can get from analyzing the data, which in turn can help us further understand how to "calm the traffic."
